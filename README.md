# Data Science Summit '23 - Data Quality Assurance Challenge

## Problem Statement Overview
This challenge addresses critical data quality issues within an insurance company's data pipeline. Participants are tasked with two main challenges: data reconciliation and retailer name prediction. The goal is to improve data accuracy and completeness for informed decision-making and analytics.


Overview
As a participant in the Data Science Summit '23, I've successfully completed the Data Quality Assurance Challenge for an insurance company. This README file summarizes the problem statement, my approach, and the deliverables for the challenge.





My Approach
For data reconciliation, I utilized Python and Pandas to compare source and target tables, identifying discrepancies, detecting duplicates, and finding missing data. I implemented logic considering case insensitivity, leading/trailing spaces, and date formats to ensure accurate reconciliation.

For retailer name prediction, I employed a Random Forest machine learning model using Scikit-Learn. This ensemble learning algorithm proved effective in predicting missing retailer names based on available data features. I ensured the model achieved high accuracy through thorough testing and validation.

Deliverables
Source Code: Python scripts for data reconciliation and retailer name prediction, incorporating the Random Forest model.
Documentation: Detailed explanation of the approach, algorithms, and methods used, including insights into the Random Forest model.
Reconciliation Results Sheet: Report showcasing identified discrepancies, duplicates, and missing data.
Prediction Results Sheet: Predicted retailer names for the testing dataset.
